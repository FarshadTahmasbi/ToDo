This sample is implemented using Jetpack Compose with MVI architecture, Inspired by a Udemy course
from [Stevdza-San](https://www.udemy.com/course/to-do-app-with-jetpack-compose-mvvm-android-development/).

Note that the code is not exactly the same as the tutorial code, I made some changes to have more
challenges.
